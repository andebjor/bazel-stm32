I2C library for STM32F4
=======================
This is a thin wrapper library designed to fit in between the STM32 low-level
interface for I2C, and what the SparkFun library expects as API.

The library assumes that the I2C1 is used, although if would be relatively
straight forward to add support for I2C2 and I2C3.
